This is my hyper-minimal CLI setup. Here's what it accomplishes:
1. Swaps base Terminal app for `iTerm 2`
2. Color palette upgrade
3. File-type syntax highlighting
4. Swaps base ls and ll commands for `Exa`
5. Adds `powerlevel10k` for upgraded prompt <sup>†</sup>
6. Adds line numbers and other helpful goodies to vim editor

That's it! Add this stuff and your CLI will look nice.


<sup>†</sup> More details on p10k:
- Adds current git branch details to prompt
- Adds useful icons and colors to prompt
- Upgrades font from default
